Bringing up ChatBot capabilities to your website

== Overview

Intercom is an automated virtual assistance chat tool—commonly referred to as a "chatbot".

You can see it as a circle-shaped chat button located on the bottom-right side of your screen.

== What does it do?

We hope that this tool will improve the journey of people visiting our website and/or community by allowing them to write questions and receive guidance in real time.

* *It is contextual*: For example, suppose that you are browsing the eXo Platform editions/pricing page on our website and would like to learn more about that: you can use this chatbot to request more information that you seek about that topic.
* It can automatically put you in touch with the right team in the back-end: If you need to contact us, this tool helps save time by collecting basic information and then redirecting straight to the right eXo person to talk to.
* It works across both sites and will recognize you as the same visitor: It won’t lose track of who you are if you navigate between our website and our online community site.

== How does it work?

Under the hood, it’s leveraging some neat/mature 3rd party chatbot technology. It’s highly configurable by our developers, allowing us to specify the workflows that power it according to different possible scenarios and navigation contexts.
This is our first experimental implementation of it and we will keep improving it.
